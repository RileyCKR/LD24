********** Objective ********** 
Infect the cells!  Avoid the large white blood cells and Y-Shaped antigens, they will kill you. After infecting 5, 10, and finally 25 cells you can evolve your virus in one of three ways.

1. More Children - Viruses more children from infection.
2. Quickness - Viruses will move and more responsive.
3. Toughness - Viruses get one free life, they won't instantly die if they touch a hostile.
